A tool for creating non-reasoning models from existing reasoning models.

## Usage

1. Use `git clone` and `pip` to prepare the environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekcbw/llm-nothink
cd llm-nothink
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
```
2. Run build scripts:
```bash
./build-qwen3-0.6b # Build the qwen3-0.6b GGUF model
# or
./build-qwen3-1.7b
./build-youtu-2b
```
For Windows, you may use Git Bash or WSL to run these scripts.
